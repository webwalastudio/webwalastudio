  {
    q: "How long does it take to build my website?",
    a: "Most websites are designed, built, and launched within 7 days. The timeline depends on how quickly you can share your content (text, images, logo). Once we have everything, we move fast.",
  },
  {
    q: "What do I need to provide to get started?",
    a: "Just your business name, logo (if you have one), a rough idea of what you want, and any photos or text you'd like on the site. No logo? No problem — we can help you with that too. We guide you through the entire process.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the website mobile-friendly?",
    a: "Yes, 100%. Every website we build is fully responsive — it looks great and works perfectly on phones, tablets, and desktops. Mobile-first design is a core part of our process, not an afterthought.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you offer website maintenance after launch?",
    a: "Yes. All plans include free maintenance — 1 month with Starter, 2 months with Professional, and 3 months with Business Pro. After that, we offer affordable annual maintenance packages so your site stays fast, secure, and up to date.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are there any hidden fees?",
    a: "No. The price you see is what you pay for the build. The only additional costs are domain name (₹800–1,500/year) and hosting (₹3,000–6,000/year) if you don't already have them — and we'll guide you through setting those up.",
  },
  {
    q: "What types of businesses do you work with?",
    a: "We work with schools, clinics, restaurants, retailers, manufacturers, consultants, NGOs, and more. If you have a business and need a professional online presence, we can help — regardless of industry.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you work with clients outside Delhi NCR?",
    a: "Yes. We work remotely with clients across India. Everything — from the briefing to the final delivery — is handled online via WhatsApp, email, and video calls. Location is no barrier.",
